00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,300
Today, I'm going to talk about the YouTube channel of Shokabo, a publisher specializing in natural science books

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,760
Huh? A publisher's channel? Is that what you're thinking?

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,260
But let me tell you, it's incredibly fascinating

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,280
Shokabo's YouTube channel is truly wonderful

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,920
If you're studying from science and engineering textbooks, this is a must-watch! I really want to recommend it

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,720
And today, I want to introduce a mystery

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,140
about an unfinished masterpiece published by Shokabo

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,800
Only the first volume was published

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,700
yet the first volume contains only the table of contents for the second volume

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,840
This is a very mysterious textbook

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,580
filled with the passionate thoughts of researchers and editors

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,480
It's a truly moving story

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,379
So about today's video

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,700
Surprisingly, this is NOT a promotion for Shokabo

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:11,380
Yes, so introducing someone else's channel doesn't earn me a single yen

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,180
But I wanted to express my gratitude for the work of publishers and editors who are essential for studying science and engineering

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,720
That's why I decided to make this video today

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,400
So, won't you become a fan of Shokabo too?

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,960
Now, for those who don't know what Shokabo is, let me give you a brief introduction

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,100
Shokabo is a publisher of natural science books in physics, mathematics, and more

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,660
On their official website, their mascot character Umeko-chan introduces their bestselling books and YouTube channel

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,880
Umeko-chan is really cute, isn't she?

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,600
So what kind of videos does Shokabo's YouTube channel have?

24
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,560
First, there are lecture videos by the textbook authors themselves

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Professor Junichiro Kishine from The Open University of Japan

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,620
has published a thermodynamics textbook through Shokabo

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,280
and amazingly, the professor himself appears

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,320
to give thermodynamics lectures

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,740
You could say the publisher is also in the business of debuting researchers as YouTubers

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,400
That's one way to look at it

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,240
And this is today's main topic

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,500
There are videos where editors share behind-the-scenes stories

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,200
These are really fascinating

34
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,880
You might think that a YouTube channel from a physics and math publisher

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,320
would just be some boring corporate promotional channel, but

36
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,180
That's not the case at all!

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Behind the publishing of natural science books lies a grand drama

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
Watching this reminded me of "The Great Passage"

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,840
I believe it's no exaggeration to say that Shokabo's YouTube is like a science version of "The Great Passage"

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,840
Let me briefly explain "The Great Passage"

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,880
It's a novel by Shion Miura

42
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,060
that won the Booksellers' Award in 2012

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,080
The story is about publishing a Japanese dictionary

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,380
and was a hit as a movie, anime, and drama

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Editors and linguists work together

46
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,480
to create a Japanese dictionary

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,660
It's a superb intellectual entertainment

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,840
I think one of the themes of "The Great Passage" is

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,300
passing on one's work and way of life to future generations

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,400
Publishing a Japanese dictionary is a massive project

51
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,560
In the story, 13 years pass

52
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,080
That's how long such work takes

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,459
Over 13 years, naturally the characters' life stages change

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,459
Some get married, senior employees retire or pass away

55
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,120
And through all this, various forms of succession are depicted, I believe

56
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,660
And the exact same thing

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,060
can be seen in Shokabo's YouTube channel

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,899
Especially in the video I'm introducing today, you can feel this strongly

59
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,080
The main video I especially want to recommend

60
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,400
from Shokabo is this one

61
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,460
The Unfinished Masterpiece

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,640
The Secret Left in the First Volume

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,940
And speaking about the passion for academic book editing

64
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,600
Connecting Knowledge

65
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,300
The title "Unfinished Masterpiece" is intriguing, isn't it?

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,759
The video features

67
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,740
Professor Isao Imai's "Fluid Mechanics (Volume 1)" textbook

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,460
This book was first published in 1973 and is still being reprinted as a masterpiece

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,880
There's also an e-book version, so you can have it without taking up shelf space

70
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,279
But this book has a big mystery

71
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,760
The title says "Volume 1" but Volume 2 doesn't exist

72
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,020
Professor Imai passed away without ever writing Volume 2

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
But there's something even more mysterious

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,960
This first volume contains the table of contents for the non-existent second volume

75
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,460
Look at this

76
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,519
Volume 2 doesn't exist, yet there's a clear outline of what was planned

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,900
Only the table of contents remains

78
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,900
Boundary layers, turbulence, magnetohydrodynamics

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Various topics are listed

80
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,220
I want to read about all of them...

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
But there's no Volume 2

82
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,100
Yet it's still being published as "Volume 1"

83
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,200
Some readers say

84
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,340
if Volume 2 isn't coming out, the table of contents shouldn't be there

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,879
I've heard there are people with that opinion

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,740
I can certainly understand that feeling

87
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,000
There were really many voices of expectation from readers

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,420
Mr. Ono, an editor at Shokabo who appears in the video

89
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,380
said that when he was a young employee answering the company phone

90
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,080
he received so many calls asking "When will Volume 2 of Professor Imai's Fluid Mechanics come out?"

91
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
There were really so many inquiries

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,599
He said there were times when he was afraid of the phone ringing

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
So why does this table of contents remain?

94
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,780
This mystery is revealed in the video

95
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,480
Editor Ono shares the story of his last meeting with Professor Imai

96
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,720
Mr. Ono visited Professor Imai's home many times

97
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,279
asking "How is the manuscript for Volume 2 coming along?"

98
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,800
Professor Imai was already in his 80s at that time

99
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,520
and must have been struggling physically and health-wise

100
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,660
Yet Mr. Ono had to follow up on the manuscript as part of his job

101
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,220
You can feel his difficulty in doing so

102
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,340
And the last time Mr. Ono met Professor Imai

103
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,900
the professor said this

104
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,579
"I'm truly sorry that I couldn't publish Volume 2"

105
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,940
"However..." What did Professor Imai say after this?

106
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,640
Please watch the full video to find out

107
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,540
Professor Imai's conviction as a researcher

108
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,660
Mr. Ono's sense of mission as an editor

109
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,460
You can feel them both

110
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,160
I was deeply moved

111
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,220
The table of contents for the non-existent Volume 2

112
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,679
is not just a table of contents

113
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,460
It represents Professor Imai's passion for fluid mechanics itself

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,000
You could say it's homework that Professor Imai left for us

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,760
That's why this table of contents remains to this day

116
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:44,139
I was moved to see that this is the work of editors, the unsung heroes of knowledge transmission

117
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,040
We can still read books published over 50 years ago thanks to the work of editors

118
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,560
We tend to think that human knowledge has progressed continuously throughout history

119
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,120
But that's not true at all. Historically, much knowledge has been lost

120
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:31,000
For example, the Library of Alexandria. This library was built in the 3rd century BC in what is now Alexandria, Egypt, and housed various books recording the knowledge of Greek civilization at the time. However, this library lost a vast amount of knowledge due to financial difficulties and wars.

121
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:44,120
A more familiar example would be broken links to references in blog posts from 10 years ago. Even events from just 10 years ago are difficult to trace accurately now

122
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:59,959
Knowledge is easily lost without effort to maintain it. Publishers and editors do the tremendously important work of passing knowledge on to the next generation

123
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,460
Shokabo's channel has many other truly valuable stories

124
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,780
For example, Professor Ryogo Kubo's "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics"

125
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,660
commonly known as "Kubo Statistics"

126
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,240
There's also a video introducing its behind-the-scenes story

127
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,620
This was first published in 1961

128
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,459
and a revised edition came out in 1998. It's a masterpiece among masterpieces

129
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,140
Mr. Ono was involved in editing the revised edition

130
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,740
"The Complete Solutions to Kubo Statistics" - anyone who has studied physics

131
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,980
would get excited

132
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,500
or get chills at this topic. The episodes about it

133
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,040
are explained in a way that even those unfamiliar with Kubo Statistics can understand

134
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,699
There are stories about mishaps when entertaining professors at the revised edition release

135
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,500
and about how editor Ono sent a complaint postcard to Shokabo about a textbook when he was a student

136
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,260
only to end up reading his own complaint postcard after joining the company

137
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,520
These human-interest episodes make it very relatable

138
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,560
It's really full of highlights

139
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,080
So if you've become even a little interested in Shokabo's YouTube channel

140
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,560
please check out the actual videos

141
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,440
If you'd like

142
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,440
please subscribe to Shokabo's YouTube channel and give them a like

143
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
I'd really appreciate it

144
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Why am I asking you to subscribe and like

145
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,800
someone else's channel instead of my own?

146
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,440
Well, it doesn't earn me anything

147
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,060
But it's truly wonderful content

148
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,900
so I really hope you'll watch it

149
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,020
See you in the next video. Take care!
